    <h4 class="mt-30" id="q1">What are the advantages of a premium account?</h4>
    <p>
      A premium account offers a couple of valuable learning functionalities that make learning easier. Premium account
      holders are able to convert speech to text (nine languages), create and do tests and set learning objectives for
      yourself or others.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also possible to create groups of external participants and add drills and tests to those groups and track
      the progress of participants. A premium account offers an unlimited storage capacity and the ability to sell your
      own drills or courses in the Drill Store, making it possible to earn money with your learning material. See also
      our page about the premium account.

    <h4 class="mt-30" id="q7">What happens to my premium account if I don't renew my subscription?</h4>
    <p>
      A premium account that is not renewed will automatically be downgraded to a free basic account. Features that are
      only available to premium account holders will no longer be available.
    </p>
    <p>
      The storage limit for the basic account will also be enforced, which may mean that not all drills in your
      repertoire will be accessible. In no case will any data be discarded.
